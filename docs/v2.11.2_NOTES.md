# 3i/ATLAS Gateway Guide v2.11.2 — Implementation Notes

**Version:** 2.11.2  
**Branch:** v2.11.2  
**Focus:** Implementing follow-up Grok recommendations (Dec 4, 2025) and improving ergonomics.

## Changes in v2.11.2

1. **Plain Mode / Simple Mode (design-level)**
   - Documented user command for “plain mode” that suppresses visible tier (T/F/C) and CHI jargon for non-experts.
   - Keeps internal governance intact; output becomes age-friendly and jargon-light.

2. **Audit Footer Toggle (CHI / Reflexion)**
   - Documented opt-in toggle so users can request a one-line self-audit footer (tiers, speculation status, Love > Fear, CHI) on every response.
   - Default behavior remains concise; audit mode makes footers persistent.

3. **Ephemeris Helper Pattern**
   - Standard response pattern for coordinate/magnitude questions:
     - Defers to JPL HORIZONS and TheSkyLive / In-The-Sky with canonical links.
     - Avoids fabricating RA/Dec; uses tools for exact values.

4. **T4 Misinfo Handling (design stub)**
   - Clarified behavior for handling viral social-media rumors:
     - Identify rumor type (impact, alien probe, cover-up).
     - Debunk with T1 sources (NASA, JPL, IAWN) and fact-checks.
     - Make clear there is no automated background “monitor,” only on-demand scans.

5. **Documentation Restructure**
   - All peer-review artifacts moved under `docs/`.
   - New external evaluations section added to README.

These notes describe design-level changes for v2.11.2 and serve as a bridge to future fully-implemented features (e.g., explicit plain-mode toggle UX, CHI footer preferences, and automated T4 rumor snapshots).
