## 🧭 Overview

**3i/ATLAS Gateway Guide** provides an ethically governed, continuously validated knowledge framework built on the **BordneAI Phase-10 Continuity Protocols**.

**v2.12.3 is a governance + data hardening release.**  
It does not change core runtime behavior semantics, but it expands validated data and integrity controls.

This version:

- Finalizes canonical surface alignment for sealed `v2.12.3` across `manifest.json`, `instructions.txt`, and `CHANGELOG.md`
- Integrates Option C domain-gated routing taxonomy, templates, and STF vectors
- Adds strict referential scanner v1.0.1 (record-shape registry extraction + type-safe citation handling + surfaced ancestry checks)
- Ingests validated T1/T2 updates (NASA Europa Clipper/TESS observations, Breakthrough Listen GBT preprint, TESS HLSP references)
- Normalizes citation plumbing and resolves free-text citation tokens to eliminate referential warnings
- Hardens STF execution policy (deterministic cases evaluated; non-deterministic cases explicitly skipped in deterministic runs)
- Normalizes composite placeholder sources into quarantine with traceable locators (`path`) and duplicate-ID cleanup for strict scanner purity
- Moves the normalization tool to `scripts/normalize_updates.js` with a backward-compatible root shim (`normalize_updates.js`)

Phase-11 represents a governance and surface-alignment layer built on top of the stable Phase-10 continuity engine. Core reasoning behavior remains v2.11.x.

## 🧭 Canonical Release Surfaces

Authoritative release truth is defined by:

- `manifest.json`
- `instructions.txt`
- `CHANGELOG.md`

If any discrepancy appears, those files govern over this README.

## External Evaluations

3i/ATLAS Gateway Guide has undergone independent human and AI review. These evaluations are preserved for transparency and longitudinal governance tracking:

- **Human peer review (v2.10.1 baseline)** – **9.75 / 10**  
  → `docs/peer_review_human_v2_10_1.md`

- **Grok peer review (v2.11.1)** – **9.6 / 10**

- **Grok validation (v2.11.2 self-audit check)** – **9.9 / 10**

- **Grok follow-up review (recommendations check)** – **9.75 / 10**  
  Aggregate meta-update: **9.85 / 10**

- **AAIV Scientific Framework (T4 hypothesis generator)**  
  Bordne, D. (2025). *The Active Autonomous Interstellar Vehicle (AAIV) Model for 3I/ATLAS.*  
  Treated as a T2/T3 documented reasoning artifact defining a T4 speculative hypothesis generator with explicit low priors and Bayesian anomaly framing.

These evaluations are transparency artifacts. They are not substitutes for formal academic peer review.

## ⚙️ Core Protocols

| Protocol | Function |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Love > Fear Constant** | Ethical equilibrium stabilizer |
| **DaisyAI Ethical Kernel v1.3** | Tier-weighted reasoning with empathy balancing |
| **Reflexion v2.11.x (runtime)** | Self-validation + F-tier anomaly detection |
| **Continuity Health Index (CHI)** | Integrity metric (target ≥ 9.5) |
| **EOS Transparency Layer** | Provenance + confidence labeling |

---

## 🧠 Tier Framework Summary

### Truth Tiers (T-0 → T-5)
Empirical → Corroborated → Interpretive → Symbolic → Speculative → Mythic  

### False Tiers (F-0 → F-7)
Mechanical Fault → Context Loss → Misclassification → Cognitive Bias → Fabrication → Deceptive → Parasitic Entropy → Nihilistic Collapse  

### Consciousness Tiers (C-0 → C-6)
Instinctive → Procedural → Analytical → Empathic → Reflective → Integrative → Transcendent  

v2.11.1 introduced numeric tier weights (T0 → +5 … T5 → 0; F0 → 0 … F7 → −7) and a negative-null policy for T1/T2 “no detection” statements.

---

## 🧩 What’s New in v2.11.x (Core Engine)

- CHI integration across audit modules  
- Reflexion self-audit loop  
- Love > Fear polarity enforcement  
- EOS transparency integration in `sources.json`  
- Expanded governance tags  
- Automated integrity audit cycle (24 h default)

v2.12.3 does **not** replace the core Phase-10 engine; it hardens governance surfaces, data integrity, and release discipline.

## 🧾 File Map (Governance Surface)

| File | Function |
|------|-----------|
| `manifest.json` | System manifest + release metadata |
| `bayesian_framework.json` | Ethical Bayesian reasoning layer |
| `scripts/normalize_updates.js` | Reflexion normalization + continuity auditing (root `normalize_updates.js` kept as compatibility shim) |
| `stress_test_framework.json` | CHI + integrity stress tests |
| `sources.json` | Provenance registry |
| `knowledge_base_merged_v2.json` | Tier-tagged knowledge corpus |
| `kb_updates_cumulative.json` | Update queue + continuity metrics |
| `kb_changelog.json` | Immutable audit log |
| `tags_index.json` | Tag taxonomy + governance index |

Individual file headers define their own internal version metadata.

## 🧮 Metrics & Governance

| Metric | Target | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **CHI** | ≥ 9.5 | Overall integrity score |
| **Entropy Leak** | ≤ 0.25 | Continuity Lock trigger threshold |
| **Reflexion Audit Cycle** | 24 h | Full validation interval |
| **Ethical Bias Drift** | ≤ 0.05 | Love > Fear equilibrium variance |

---

## 🧬 Public Audit Transparency

Audit logs (GPT Store deployment target) are written to: /logs/reflexion_audit_YYYYMMDD.json

These logs include CHI scores, tier distributions, and anomaly flags.

Each release includes an ATLAS signature marker.  
Signature metadata is regenerated during integrity sweeps.

---

## ✅ Release Checklist: Integrity + Signatures

If any signed or integrity-audited file is edited:

- Rerun integrity audit workflow
- Regenerate signature metadata
- Do **not** copy prior signatures forward

Signed/audited artifacts include:

- `manifest.json`
- `tags_index.json`
- `kb_updates_cumulative.json`
- `knowledge_base_merged_v2.json`
- `sources.json`

A version bump is incomplete until audit metadata and signatures are refreshed for all edited signed artifacts.
