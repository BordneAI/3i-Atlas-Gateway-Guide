## Overview

The 3I/ATLAS Gateway Guide implements **symbol-based epistemic governance** for domains where evidence conflicts, stakes are high, and uncertainty must be managed rigorously.

**Core Capabilities:**
- **Tiered source validation** (T1-T4): Distinguishes peer-reviewed archives from attributed testimony
- **Symbol-based compliance tracking** (✅🔍🌀⚠️): Real-time verification status for every claim
- **Entropy calibration**: Appropriate confidence levels for contested domains (L1-L5 scoring)
- **Falsification protocols**: Systematic challenge and evidence evaluation
- **Adaptive clarification**: Context-aware disambiguation for ambiguous queries
- **BAAM verification**: Bayesian Anomaly Assessment Module for weighted evidence analysis

**Built on the principle:** *Verifiability must precede capability*

## User Interface

### Interactive Menu System
The GPT provides a structured navigation system accessible via numeric commands:

**Primary Navigation** (Type number to access):
- `1` - ✅ Facts & timeline (verified data with source provenance)
- `2` - 🔭 Visibility & UTC timing (observation planning)
- `3` - 🔍 Interpretations & perspectives (analysis frameworks)
- `4` - 🌀 Daily practices (consciousness preparation protocols)
- `5` - 📜 Protocols: 11/11 (specific event guidance)
- `6` - 🧭 Stages & milestones (temporal progression tracking)
- `7` - 🛰️ Sources & verification (tiered evidence registry)
- `8` - 🔄 Updates & research (latest developments)
- `9` - 🌍 Contact preparation (consciousness expansion frameworks)
- `10` - 🧩 Anomalies: "Buga Sphere" (contested phenomena analysis)
- `11` - 📡 Advanced: radio (receive-only monitoring protocols)
- `12` - 🖼️ ASCII templates (visualization tools)
- `13` - 💬 Conversation starters (persona-aware entry points)
- `14` - 🧾 Auditor mode (safety overlay for high-stakes queries)
- `15` - 💡 Sample responses (framework demonstrations)
- `16` - ⚡ Optimize (Menu Analyzer - UX refinement)

**System Commands:**
- `97` - 🛠️ Tools (Horizons wizard, visibility pack, confidence bars)
- `98` - 🎛️ Settings (token budgeting, response size, entropy display)
- `99` - 🧭 Show menu (redisplay navigation)
- `911` - 🚨 Safety rules (refusal protocols and red lines)

**Sub-menus:** Hierarchical navigation (e.g., `1.1` Overview, `1.2` Timeline, `7.1` T1 sources, `7.2` T2 sources)

### Conversation Starters
Pre-configured entry points tailored to user personas:
- **Advanced Researcher:** Observatory monitoring and verification protocols
- **Skeptical Scientist:** Viral claim evaluation and evidence standards
- **Consciousness Explorer:** Frameworks beyond scientific measurement
- **Critical Observer:** Instrument artifacts vs. genuine phenomena

### Provenance Indicators
Every factual claim includes:
- `source_id` - Direct reference to sources.json registry
- `as_of` - Verification timestamp (YYYY-MM-DD)
- `confidence` - Level: extremely_high | high | medium | low | extremely_low

### Symbol Legend
- ✅ **Verified Fact** — T1/T2 sourced, high confidence
- 🔍 **Interpretation** — Analysis, hypothesis, non-consensus claim
- 🌀 **Practice** — Consciousness/preparation techniques (no truth claims)
- ⚠️ **Caution** — Safety concern, epistemic boundary, or red line

### Entropy Domain Control
Real-time query complexity assessment (L1-L5):
- **L1-L2:** Concise facts, minimal clarification
- **L3:** Moderate ambiguity, selective web search
- **L4:** High complexity, batch verification, heavy citations
- **L5:** Unsafe/speculative, refusal with safe alternatives

## Demonstration Domain

The framework is demonstrated through analysis of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, a contested high-entropy domain involving:
- Multi-agency data (NASA JPL, ESA, observatory networks)
- Competing hypotheses and expert disagreement  
- Technical complexity requiring tiered evidence standards
- Real-time data updates and anomaly assessment

This demonstrates how the framework handles domains where **truth is contested, evidence is ambiguous, and institutional sources may conflict**.

## Architecture

### Files
- `knowledge_base_merged_v2.json` — Structured KB with deployment context, risk assessments, and expert perspectives
- `instructions.txt` — Core governance protocols (v2.10.1)
- `sources.json` — Tiered evidence registry (T1/T2/T3/T4 classification)
- `manifest.json` — Version control and system architecture
- `bayesian_framework.json` — BAAM v1.0 weighted verification framework
- `conversation_starters.json` — Persona-aware entry points
- `stress_test_framework.json` — Integrity validation protocols
- Supporting files: `kb_changelog.json`, `kb_updates_cumulative.json`, `tags_index.json`

### Audit Status
- ✅ JSON validity: All files pass validation
- ✅ Manifest alignment: 11/11 files present
- ✅ Referential integrity: All KB `source_id`s resolve
- ✅ Tier compliance: T1/T2/T3/T4 standards enforced
- ✅ 9/9 model consensus verification (see `META-VERIFICATION-9OF9`)
- ✅ BAAM verification: Bayesian weighted evidence analysis enabled

### Tools & Features
- **Horizons Quick-Wizard:** Builds JPL Horizons query parameters
- **Local Visibility Pack:** UTC→Local conversion with observation checklists
- **Canvas Insight Blocks:** Side-by-side Facts | Press | Practices
- **Confidence Bar:** Visual T1-T4 evidence mix representation
- **Mini-Timeline Renderer:** Discovery → Perihelion → Visibility → Close Approach → Exit

---

## Applicability

This framework applies to **any domain** where:
- Evidence quality varies across sources
- Institutional claims may conflict with observational data
- Uncertainty must be communicated transparently
- Stakes require defensible reasoning

**Example domains:** Historical contested testimony, policy analysis under uncertainty, technical governance, anomaly investigation, intelligence assessment.

---

## Refusals & Red Lines

The framework maintains strict safety boundaries and will refuse:
1. Transmit-capable radio instructions (receive-only monitoring is permitted)
2. Medical advice beyond "consult healthcare provider"
3. Specific geographic "contact zones"
4. Unverified claims represented as T1/T2 facts
5. Definitive predictions about consciousness effects

All refusals include **Redline Coach** explanations with safe alternatives.
